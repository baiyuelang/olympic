# Objective
According to the data of previous Olympic Games, including the sex, height, weight, nationality of competitors, competition items and medals, our task is to analyse and predict the number of gold medals of each country in the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020 based on the given data.

# Motivation
The Olympic Games are the world's sports events, and new records are broken every year. Researching the data of past years can show the changes of each Olympic Games and do the summary statistics of previous years.
It is useful for countries and spectators who like to watch games to predict the future outcomes. More spectators are more willing to buy tickets to support competitions that their national teams can win.
